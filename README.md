A [Discord](https://discord.com/) bot built around hosting a Minecraft Server.

## What is Masa
Masa is a bot that allows you to control a [Minecraft Java server](https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/download/server) through [Discord](https://discord.com/). It also does a few other things that may even replace some popular plugins.

## Key features
- Automatic server installation
- Server backups
- Custom permission system
- Server welcome messages
- Two way chat between Discord and players on the server
- Send commands to the Minecraft server from Discord
- Server status can be seen on Discord

## Where does it run?
Masa has been tested on Windows 10/11 & Ubuntu 20.04 (LTS) x64
## Does it support my server?
Presumably, YES!

Masa is fully compatible with almost any popular Minecraft Java server type.

Although Masa currently officially supports [Vanilla](https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/download/server), [Paper](https://papermc.io/) and [Spigot](https://www.spigotmc.org/) support for more server types is coming!

**Note**: If a server type you want to use is not officially supported it may (and probably **will**) work.

**Note**: [Forge](https://forums.minecraftforge.net/) support is on its way!

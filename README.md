A [Discord](https://discord.com/) bot built around hosting a Minecraft Server.

## Why?
The original creator [Tembero11](https://github.com/Tembero11) had a [Minecraft server](https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/download/server) server with a few of his friends and needed an easy way to control the server. That's when he had the idea to make a bot that allows controlling a minecraft server through [Discord](https://discord.com/).

## Where does it run?
Masa has been tested on Windows 10/11 & Ubuntu 20.04 (LTS) x64
## Does it support my server?
Presumably, YES!

Masa is fully compatible with almost any popular Minecraft Java server type.

Although Masa currently officially supports only [Vanilla](https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/download/server), [Paper](https://papermc.io/) and [Spigot](https://www.spigotmc.org/) support for more server types is coming!

**Note**: If a server type you want to use is not officially supported it may (and probably **will**) work.

**Note**: [Forge](https://forums.minecraftforge.net/) support is on its way!
